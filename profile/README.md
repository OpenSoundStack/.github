# OpenSoundStack
OpenSoundStack is a collection of projects forming a complete live audio performance environment.
There are three on-going projects :
 - [OpenDSP](https://github.com/OpenSoundStack/OpenDSP), an optimized DSP library targeting ARM and its NEON extension for embedded systems
 - [OpenAudioNetwork](https://github.com/OpenSoundStack/OpenAudioNetwork), an Audio over Ethernet low-latency audio transport protocol
 - [OpenAudioLiveSystem](https://github.com/OpenSoundStack/OpenAudioLiveSystem), a nice UI and the complete environment of the live audio system putting together OpenDSP and OpenAudioNetwork

Feel free to contribute, share your ideas or just follow the project :D
